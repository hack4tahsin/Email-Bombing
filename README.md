# Email Bombing

An email bomb is a denial-of-service attack that involves sending large volumes of messages to an email address. Email bombing usually aims to render the victim’s email unusable or hide important messages (such as security breach alerts) in the torrent. The recipient of an email bomb may not be the attacker’s intended victim — criminals can also flood random mailboxes with junk to bring down the server hosting them.

# Attack Demonstration:

## Performing Attack:

Run the email bombing.py file to execute the attack. In the code, you have to give your email, the victim's email, the app password, and the SMTP server's port address. Also, you can set the perimeter. I have set it to 1000.
